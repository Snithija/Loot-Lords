# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Pre-deployment Checklist ✅

- [x] Build works locally (`npm run build`)
- [x] Node.js version specified (18.x)
- [x] Proper `vercel.json` configuration
- [x] All dependencies installed
- [x] No build errors

## Common Vercel Issues & Solutions

### 1. Build Command Issues

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 2. Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, make sure they're set in Vercel dashboard:

```
VITE_API_URL=your_api_url_here
```

### 3. Node.js Version

- Specified in `package.json`: `"node": "18.x"`
- Also in `.nvmrc`: `18`

### 4. Static Assets

- All images should be in `public/images/`
- Paths should start with `/images/` not `./images/`

### 5. Routing (SPA)

- `vercel.json` includes rewrites for client-side routing
- All routes will fallback to `/index.html`

## Deployment Steps

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Vercel should auto-deploy
3. Check deployment logs for any errors
4. Verify build settings in Vercel dashboard
