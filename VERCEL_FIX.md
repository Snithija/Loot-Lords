# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:

### ❌ **Issue Found:** Duplicate Import Conflict

**Location**: `src/pages/Products/index.jsx`

```jsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
import ProductGrid from "./ProductGrid";
import ProjectGrid from "./ProductGrid"; // ❌ DUPLICATE/TYPO

// AFTER (FIXED):
import ProductGrid from "./ProductGrid"; // ✅ SINGLE CORRECT IMPORT
```

### ❌ **Issue Found:** Conflicting Vercel Configuration

**Problem**: Manual build commands conflicted with Vercel's auto-detection

**FIXED**: Simplified `vercel.json` to let Vercel auto-detect Vite:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ **All Issues Resolved:**

- [x] Duplicate import removed from Products page
- [x] Vercel auto-detection enabled
- [x] Node.js version set to >=18.0.0
- [x] Build successfully completes locally
- [x] All components properly imported
